This is one of my university projects. It's just a simple game, where you have to collect all the baskets with the bear.
Use the cursor buttons to move the bear. After every one block of movement of Mr. Bear, the rangers move one block as well.
You win the game if you collect all the baskets, and you lose the game, if a ranger catches you, meaning that you got into the direct vicinity of one of them (block of 3*3)
